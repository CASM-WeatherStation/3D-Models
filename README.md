# 3D-Models
This repository holds the .STL models that were made for this project.

For the lower compartment and door, resources were used from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2282869. The creator, a user who goes by "deba168" (Debasish Dutta) created a series of models for the use in a Solar Powered WiFi Weather Station. I have used one model of theirs to create my own small enclosure after duplicating the model used for the door (which has some lovely louvered shutters) multiple times until a box was formed.
